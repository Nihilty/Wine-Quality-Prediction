# Wine-Quality-Prediction
In this project we will use linear regression to predict the quality of wine and calculate the mean squared error and R-squared score as a measure of model performance.

The provided Python code uses linear regression to predict the quality of wine based on features such as acidity, pH, and alcohol content. The code first loads the wine dataset and explote the data and analyse it, perform feature engineering and split it into training and testing sets. It then creates a linear regression model and trains it on the training set. The model is then used to make predictions on the testing set, and the mean squared error and R-squared score is calculated as a measure of how well the model fits the data. The code outputs the R-squared score, which can be used to assess the model's performance.
